// The Assistant, played as a game: the office is the assistant, every real item has a place in it,
// and every real move you make earns points. Pure and dependency-free (test/assistantGame.test.mjs) -
// GameScene draws it, AssistantGame calls the real endpoints, this file only decides WHERE a thing
// lives, WHO should take it, and WHAT the move was worth.
//
// Nothing here reads words. A zone comes from the lane triage already judged, a match from the
// kind it already chose (no-hardcoded-words: the model reads intent, code only routes on it).
