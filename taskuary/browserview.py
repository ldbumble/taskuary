"""The agent's browser, watched live beside its terminal.

A coding session drives a headless Chrome through agent-browser (clis.TOOLS) from its own
terminal, and until now that was all you saw of it - text scrolling past. This is the other
half: the owner watches the page the agent is on, in the task page and on the Wall, and can
take the keyboard when a page asks for something an agent must never type (a password, a
2FA code).

How the two are tied together, with NO cooperation from the agent: every pty gets
AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION=tq-<sid> in its environment (terminal.clean_env), so whatever
`agent-browser` command the agent runs lands in a session named after the terminal it ran
in. agent-browser keeps that session's state in ~/.agent-browser/<name>.* - `.stream` is the
port of its screencast WebSocket (always on, frames start when a client attaches), `.target`
the page it is on. Reading those files is how Taskuary knows a browser is open; connecting to
that port is how it shows it. No CLI call on the poll path, no daemon of our own.

The relay is a plain pipe: agent-browser's messages (frame / url / status / tabs / console,
JSON text) go to the page, the page's messages (input_mouse / input_keyboard / ack) go back.
Ack pacing is requested on the upstream URL and the RENDERER's acks are forwarded, which is
what keeps a slow tab looking at the current page instead of ten seconds of history - the
proxy generating acks itself would leave frames queued on the far side (agent-browser's
streaming notes say exactly this).
