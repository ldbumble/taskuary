"""Setting a coding CLI up: its own first run, in a pane Taskuary hosts.

The Install button removed the first dead end and landed on the next one. A CLI installed sixty
seconds ago has never been run - no theme, no trusted folder, no account - so the wizard's
Add & test failed, and `agents.signed_out_msg` told the owner to "open a terminal", about an app
that has had a real interactive pty all along.

WHAT OPENS IS THE CLI, PLAIN. Every one of these ships an onboarding that asks for what it needs -
recommended settings, then the sign-in - and it asks better than we could ask on its behalf. An
earlier draft of this drove one slice of that from outside, typing `/login` into the box off a
per-CLI table of login recipes. Letting the CLI run itself deleted the table: `codex login` and a
typed `/login` were two shapes of the same thing, and the thing is "just start it".

So the only per-CLI knowledge left is WHICH NAMES may be started, and that stays closed for the
reason cliinstall.RECIPES is closed: this runs a program on the owner's machine.

A set-up IS a setup task, for the reasons aisetup already argues: the owner types secrets into it,
so nothing is filed on the task; Done is a plain close (coder.wrap routes Kind='setup' to
aisetup.finish); and it belongs on the Board, because an agent working is an agent working
wherever it started.

THE ONE DIVERGENCE from aisetup: it needs a configured agent profile, and the CLI this exists for
has none - the profile is what Add & test writes, one step later. So the binary comes from
cliinstall.find (which looks past this process's stale PATH), and the pane is a Term built here
rather than terminal.open_session. open_session resolves profiles, guesses checkouts, installs
hooks, tells the peer blackboard - and PRE-TRUSTS the folder, which exists to stop a headless
agent parking on the trust dialog. Here the owner is sitting in front of it, and that dialog is
part of the setup they came to do. agent=None keeps the pane off the blackboard and off the roster.

# exists to let the owner have. argv() still refuses it when the binary is absent, which on
