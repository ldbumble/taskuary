// One error body, read two ways: shown to the owner, and acted on by the code.
//
// FastAPI puts an ARRAY OF OBJECTS in `detail` for a validation error, and rendering that in JSX
// crashes React (#31) and blanks the whole app - so every non-string detail is normalized to a
// string, and ~130 `setErr(detail || "...")` sites depend on that.
//
// The STRUCTURE is the other half: a refused read says `{code, message}`, and processingErrorCode
// reads the code to decide what to DO about it (fall back to the legacy Timeline, reload an
// expired page, retry the pile in 1200ms). Flattening both halves at once is what left a routine
// "membership is being reconciled" showing as axios's own "Request failed with status code 409"
// with every one of those recoveries unreachable - a red banner over something that had already
// healed (seen on the owner's Timeline, 2026-09-10). So the structure is kept ON THE ERROR, where
// only the deciding code looks for it.
