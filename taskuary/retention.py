"""Chat retention (PW-156 to PW-161): archived guide conversations expire on their own clock.

A history read used to be the cleanup: concierge.chats() marked anything older than a hardcoded twenty
days `dropped` on the way past, so listing past chats mutated them. Retention is now one scheduled
lifecycle operation - once a day, from the app's own clock - with a setting (`chat_keep_days`,
fifteen by default). It removes only ARCHIVED guide conversations whose last word is older than the
cutoff: never the open chat, never a real task. What a chat said about a task was mirrored onto that
task as it was said (concierge.record_related), operation receipts and correction evidence are keyed
to their targets, and memories and rules are their own rows - none of it lives on the archive, so
none of it goes with it.
