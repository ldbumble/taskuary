"""One lane vocabulary, in one file, for both languages.

The words a lane wears were kept by hand in two tables - `funnel.LANE_WORDS`/`LANE_MARKS` here and
`LANE_META` in website/src/funnelPile.js - plus a third copy of the counting words written out inline
in AssistantView. Nothing checked them against each other, so they drifted: the server said a report
lane reads "landed" while the page said "report", and there was no way to tell which was the mistake
(the owner, 2026-09-15: "we built one idea and then it was changed... it's in a bunch of places").

Both sides now build their tables from taskuary/lanes.json. These tests keep it that way: a word
added to one language and not the other is not possible, because there is only one place to add it.
