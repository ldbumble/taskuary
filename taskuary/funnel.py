"""The shared displayed funnel and captured assistant selection.

Five attention bands promote urgent requests/current or imminent calendar events,
then owner input/approval, other actionable work/results, FYIs, and working agents.
Saved triage priority and oldest activity order each band; stable keys break ties.
Presentation lanes remain available for their existing controls and status copy.

This ordering activation preserves the existing read, age, mute and capacity rules
