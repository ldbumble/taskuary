"""Replies: the other half of the funnel, and the cheap half.

Most inbound mail does not need an agent, a repo or a session - it needs an answer. Triage
already separates those (reply_only vs task); this writes the answer with the MAIN AI, in
the owner's voice per SOUL.md, and parks it for approval. Approving sends it (see outbound).

Drafting used to require a CLI agent named `responder`. Nobody has one, so reply-only mail
sat in the queue undrafted - and the fallback was worse: the *coding* agent, opened on a
repo, to write two sentences of email.

Every reply comes through `write_draft`: the mail that only ever needed an answer, and the
mail a coder just finished the work behind. The coder reports what it did; the reply is
written here either way, so the sender always hears one voice.
