"""LEARNED.md, as a picture: what drives what, and each line's life on one clock.

The document is unusually concrete for a learned profile - every machine-written line carries
`[s:N | ev: id,id | seen: date | k: key]` - so it can be drawn instead of read: a line, the verdicts
that fed it (mem/rv/task ids resolve to real rows), its score, and where it sits (live, proposed,
still a hypothesis). The `k:` is the line's identity across rewrites, so a reflection rephrasing at
the margins no longer orphans its history; `effective()` is what the score is worth today, since a
line still under test decays rather than keeping forever what it earned once.

That decay is measured in REFLECTIONS, not in days. A calendar punishes a line for the owner
being on holiday: nothing could have confirmed it, so nothing should have cost it (the owner,
2026-09-07: "it will just decay from not being seen"). A reflection is the honest unit - it runs
only when corrections are actually queued (learn.reflect_if_due), and one that read the window
and left a line alone IS a non-confirmation. A quiet funnel runs no reflections and decays nothing.

What the doc does NOT keep is history: a line that lost a point or died simply changes or vanishes. `record()` diffs the tagged lines on every machine write
(learn.learn_from, learn.reflect) into `learned_history`, so from now on the ledger can show the
exact verdict that demoted or deleted a line - the thing discussion #27 asked for.
