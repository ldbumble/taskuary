"""Setting Taskuary up, as a walk through the app rather than a form that imitates it.

The chip this sits behind used to open an AI-led walk-through, which could not run at all before an
AI was connected - which is exactly when somebody presses it. So nothing here reaches a model: a
stop is static text plus a read off the store, and Next is code.

That is not a lesser version of the assistant, it is how the assistant already works: deterministic
steps, with the AI for anything off script. A question typed during the walk is an ordinary turn,
answered beside the walk rather than inside it, and the assistant's own fallback already speaks in
facts when there is no model to answer it. The walk keeps its place and Next picks the script back up.

TWO KINDS OF TEXT live in a stop, and the difference is the whole design:

  `can`   - what the app can DO here. Static, hard-coded, the same on every install. Assembling it
            at runtime would make it go blank on a fresh install, which is the one install reading it.
  `facts` - what THIS install has done. Read off the same tables `setup.state` reads, so a stop can
            never claim something the checklist contradicts.
