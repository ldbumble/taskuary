"""Taskuary desktop: the same server + UI in a native window, shipped as one executable.

The FastAPI app runs on a free localhost port in a background thread; pywebview (Edge
WebView2 on Windows) hosts the UI. No pywebview -> graceful fallback to the default
browser, so `taskuary-desktop` is useful even from a bare pip install. Build the single
exe with `pyinstaller taskuary.spec` (see the spec at the repo root).
