    pydantic, ~600 modules) and only then runs the lifespan. The browser therefore opened on a
    dead port and the owner got their browser's own "site can't be reached" (2026-09-09) - which
    no splash of ours can replace, because that page is Chrome's, not the app's.

    `wait` arrives already imported and this thread imports NOTHING, because uvicorn is importing
    taskuary.server on the main thread at the same moment. The first version imported urllib in
    here and deadlocked against urllib3's six shim over there: the port never opened, and the app
    the owner had just started sat there dead for as long as they left it (2026-09-09).

    If it never answers the browser still opens: degrade to the old behaviour, which at least
    shows the owner something, rather than to a window that never appears.
