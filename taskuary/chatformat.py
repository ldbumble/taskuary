"""A report, or anything else we say, as a CHAT can hold it.

The morning digest reached WhatsApp as two bubbles of seven thousand characters, broken
mid-sentence and both folded behind "Read more" (the owner, 2026-09-19, with a screenshot).
Most of it was the `--- raw data ---` evidence dump - everything the model was GIVEN - which
the desktop has always hidden. The desktop already knows how to show a report: cut at the
marker, group it into sections, list the items (assistantCards.jsx, digestText.js). This is
that, for a chat, plus the one thing a chat needs that a page does not: the text has to be
spelled the way the channel renders it.

WhatsApp formats client-side, so `*one star*` IS bold there and `**two**` arrives as literal
punctuation. Telegram renders nothing at all unless the send sets a parse mode, and neither
sender does, so it gets the words with no marks on them. One markup in, two spellings out.
