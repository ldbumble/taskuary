// The AI defaults panel: who triages, who codes, who assists — and on WHICH MODEL, in one
// place. Before this, Settings named a brain and stopped: the model that brain would actually
// run lived on the connector's card, or on the CLI profile's light-model field, or in a plain
// text box, depending on what you had picked. Three defaults, three screens, and the page that
// chose the brain could not tell you what was about to happen (the owner, 2026-09-10).
//
// So every row here answers the same two questions out loud — what runs, and who owns it — and
// writes each half back to the screen that owns it. Nothing is stored twice: the connector card
// and Connections → AI CLI agents remain the truth and keep working.
