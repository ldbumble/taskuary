    day it ran, and never again - so Devin and Copilot, installed months later and detected by

    2026-09-14: "any ai cli agents should be possible to start no? isn't that the whole idea of it").

    So: a known CLI that is installed gets its CONNECTION from clis.KNOWN, which already carries the
    headless flags each one needs. It gets no worker - a CLI is a brain, and the picker offers
    brains directly. It used to mint a coding worker named after the CLI, carrying CODER.md and
    the same purpose line as every other, so the only thing that varied between them was which CLI
