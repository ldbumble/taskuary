    # receipt says so).
    # 'queued' belongs with them. A task handed to an agent that has not started is forced unread by the
    # clause above, so its receipts - all of them read - decide nothing, and with no shown-mark either
    # there was nothing left to keep it out of the walk: Next introduced it, Next chose it again, for as
    # long as the owner kept pressing (the owner, 2026-09-14: "i keep on clicking next on the assistant
    # idea but it just comes right back behind the current one"). It stays unread, so the work tab still
    # holds it; it is simply no longer the thing the walk offers next.
    # ...for the same hour the receipt holds. A new chat clears the mark for agent: keys only
    # (funnel.reset_walk), so on these rows it held for good: the quiet hour brought a task waiting to
    # start back unread (`back`, above), the walk skipped it for the mark, and stranded it at the end
    # as "1 unread thing still waits. Say next" for as long as Next was pressed (the owner, 2026-09-18:
    # "it skipped it but then saw it at the end and hitting next just confuses it"). The mark ages out
    # with the receipt, so the row comes round again when the quiet hours bring it back.
    # ONE CLOCK FOR ALL OF THEM (the owner, 2026-09-23: "promote later after an hour or so unless it's
    # silenced until tomorrow"): an agent waiting on you and a reply ready kept a 30-minute cooldown of their own
    # and the mark for good, so the rail's Passed band and the walk disagreed about when they were back.
    # The mark is the timer now - task_return_minutes, three hours by default - and Remind me is the silence.
