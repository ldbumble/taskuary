// THE RAIL IS THE MAP OF SETTINGS. Configuration used to be one page behind a strip of eleven
// pills, and eleven pills do not fit across a 980px page - "Display" was cut in half by the right
// edge, and the answer to "there will be more settings" was a strip that could hold fewer of them
// (the owner, 2026-09-18). So every group is a section of one scrolling page, the rail lists them
// under Configuration, and picking one scrolls to it. These tests pin the three things that have
// to agree: what the rail draws, what the page stamps an id on, and what search says the path is.
