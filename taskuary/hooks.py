"""The agent tells Taskuary what it is doing - through the CLI's own hooks.

A live session is a pty: the Board sees a terminal, not tool calls. Hooks fix that without touching
the agent. Claude Code and Codex fire the same event schema; each event's JSON reaches us and becomes
a worker event (workerstate.py), so a surface reads "Edit taskuary/server.py · 4s" or "coder is stuck -
rate limit" instead of guessing from the screen. Off with the agent_hooks setting.

TWO TRANSPORTS, measured on the owner's box 2026-09-20. Claude runs a hook's command in a shell with the
network open, so its hook POSTs the event to /api/hooks/claude. Codex runs a hook's command where no
network call succeeds - curl by name, by absolute path and wrapped in cmd all failed, with the sandbox
on AND off - while writing a file succeeds every time. So Codex's hook appends the payload to a spool
file in Taskuary's home and CodexSpool tails it. Same receiver either way.

INSTALLED ONCE, AT USER SCOPE (~/.claude/settings.json, ~/.codex/hooks.json). Set-up installs them right
after installing the CLI, before any checkout exists; a session merely refreshes them and retires the
old per-checkout entries, so no event ever fires twice (a doubled Stop is a doubled wrap-up). The owner's
own CLI in the same folder is bound apart by session id (receive). Codex runs a user-scope hook only
once it is trusted inside the TUI - which a pty never can be - so the session's argv carries
--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust (clis.py); the sandbox bypass beside it already granted more.
