// The Install button for a coding CLI, shared by the setup wizard and the AI CLI agents page.
// Both had the same dead end: "not installed on this machine", and nothing to press.
//
// The install runs in a thread on the server (a whole CLI over npm is a minute on a slow line),
// so this posts once and then polls the phase. What comes back that matters is `path` - the
// ABSOLUTE path of the binary. A GUI app keeps the PATH it was launched with, so a profile saved
// as bare "claude" works tomorrow; one saved as the path the installer just reported works now.
//
// What gets posted is the row's `install` - the RECIPE it is an install of - never its name: a
// profile is named for its job, and every install ships one called "coder".
