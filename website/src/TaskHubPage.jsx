// The strip reads left to right as the day does: what arrived (Timeline), what is being worked
// (Board, Tasks), then what has been WRITTEN DOWN - Reports and Hub, which holds hard-earned
// discoveries and developed company ideas - and last the plumbing. Hub was next to Board first,
// which put a slow surface in the middle of the two fast ones. Nine tabs was the most this strip
// held at a readable size; it holds seven now, and the next one still has to displace something.
//
// THERE IS NO REVIEW TAB. It used to be here because a proposal (proposals.py, Kind 'action')
// carries no MessageId and so has no Timeline row of its own - but it does have a TASK, and the
// task page decides it now, in stage 3 beside the reply. Nothing is left needing a third place:
// work's decisions live on its task, and answering filed chatter - the one thing that never
// becomes a task - is decided in the Assistant, on the card that offered the reply.
// Its red count came with it and sits on Tasks, counting TASKS rather than reviews.
//
// Docs is not here either: it is a section of Settings, after About you. That also keeps the
// strip symmetric about the Assistant, three tabs to each side.
//
// The Assistant IS the Timeline: one tab, the Timeline's rail with the pipe at its top on the left
// and Taskuary's chat on the right (AssistantView.jsx, funnel.py). It wears the mark in the MIDDLE
// of the strip - what is being worked to the left of it, what has been written down and the
// plumbing to the right. "Timeline" as a destination still resolves to it (go()).
// THE CANVAS REDESIGN (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-29-assistant-canvas-redesign-design.md): the tab strip is gone. The
// Assistant IS the app - its sidebar drives the work and its canvas shows a task, an agent, a connector, a setting or a
// report inside the conversation - and the Board, the agents and their wall, is the one full-screen view, reached from the
// top bar. Every old destination still lands: go("Connections") and #connector=... open that card in the canvas.
