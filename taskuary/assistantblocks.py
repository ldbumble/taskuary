"""WHAT THE ASSISTANT READS, declared. Every block of its model input is one entry here: what it is
called, which tables it reads, the SQL behind it (or that it is composed in code and cannot be one
statement), how far back it looks and how many rows it takes. `assistant.inputs` walks this list;
the Reports card renders it; the post names the block behind each line. The list used to be nine
hardcoded calls inside inputs(), which is why an owner could rewrite the instruction to say "look at
the past month" and change nothing - the month was never in the payload.

This task MOVES NO LOGIC: every build below delegates to the function in assistant.py that already
did the work, and the defaults render the payload byte for byte as it rendered before blocks
existed (tests/test_assistant_blocks.py)."""
