"""Workflows are configured jobs; procedures are how a matching request is handled (PW-203 to PW-208).

A WORKFLOW is a scheduled or hand-run job the owner configured on the Reports tab's Workflows shelf: the
`agent` source with its write grant, or the monthly invoice job. It carries its objective, its configured
inputs, the connections it names, its steps (a saved skill), what it may do, what it must ask first, and
when it is done. A PROCEDURE is a playbook (playbooks.py): how this company handles ONE kind of incoming
request, chosen by triage when a message is an instance of it. The two were one shelf; converting every
playbook into a scheduled job would have been wrong, so the existing definitions stay exactly where they
are and this module only reads them apart (PW-207).

A triggered workflow used to run inside the report loop through a coding CLI, then file its answer as a
report that triage read back as a fresh arrival. Now it is dispatched straight to its worker (PW-204): a
task carrying the definition and this run's context, opened through the same capacity and startup-retry
gates as any unattended start (ingest._auto_general / _auto_code), never through message triage, and never
a coding agent unless the definition says the job is code (a checkout to work in, or `runs_on: coding`).
The brief the worker reads is the workflow's own (PW-206); no procedure selection is needed for it.
