"""Any mailbox as an inbound channel: IMAP in, SMTP out - the protocols every provider speaks.

Outlook/Microsoft 365 has its own connector (Graph does threading and attachments better
there), but the rest of the world is Gmail, a domain.com mailbox, Yahoo, an ISP - and they
all take IMAP with a password or app password. Two catalog cards (`gmail` pre-filled,
`imap` blank) share this one implementation; both land messages as channel 'email', through
the same triage, with the same attachment pipeline, and replies go back over SMTP in-thread
(In-Reply-To/References), from the same address the mail arrived at.

# encrypted and the server is the right one - the name on the certificate just is not yours.

#   <sha256>    accept exactly THIS certificate, whatever name it carries. The name check is off

#               part "just turn verification off" throws away.
#   any         no checking at all - for a self-signed server, when there is nothing to pin to.

# message, copy the line it gives you. There is no dialog because there is nobody at the screen
