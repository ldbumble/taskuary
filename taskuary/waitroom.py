"""The waiting room: what the owner thinks of WHILE an agent is working, held until it stops.

Ideas arrive mid-run - "also handle the null case", "rename that flag", "check the other repo" -
and both ways of giving them to a coding agent were bad: interrupt it (an agent mid-edit loses
its thread; "LLMs Get Lost in Multi-Turn Conversation" puts the turn-splitting tax at ~-39%,
almost all of it unreliability), or hold them in your head and retype them when it finally
stops. So they queue HERE, on the task, and are typed into the session as ONE batch at the next
boundary: the agent parked at its prompt (terminal silent for IDLE_WAITING seconds - the same
fact the Board reads as "waiting on you"). When it parked because it ASKED something, the words the
owner writes next are its ANSWER and go in at once, plainly: waiting behind the question meant
they never arrived, and the agent sat on a question the owner had already answered on screen.

A session that has ENDED with notes still waiting (headless run finished, TUI closed) reopens
one on the same task with the notes as the ask - same task, fresh agent, never a chained session.
Affinity's cousin: dispatchq queues TASKS behind an agent; the waiting room queues WORDS for one.
