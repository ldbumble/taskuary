"""Per-action authority: how far may an agent reach through a connection?

`Roles` says WHAT a connection is for (trigger/feed/report/tool/notify). Scope says HOW FAR
an agent may go once it is a tool - the difference between "the agents may use Jira" and
"the agents may close Jira tickets". Three levels, ordered, each containing the ones before:

    read   - list, fetch, search, query. Nothing upstream changes.
    write  - plus the everyday work: create, update, comment, send a reply.
    admin  - plus the destructive and the structural: delete, run code on a box, manage access.

The ceiling is one dropdown on the connector card. Every action declares what it needs, and
an action nobody classified needs 'write' - guessing 'read' for an unrecognised verb is how
an agent quietly changes something nobody authorised. Fail closed and be wrong in the
direction that asks permission.

Pure, like policy.py: dicts in, a decision out, no store and no network, so the whole table
is unit-testable offline. `Scope` on the connector row is the owner's setting; the defaults
below are what each connection could already do before scopes existed, so switching a
version on changes nothing until the owner tightens it.
