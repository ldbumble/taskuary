A mail arrived alone: triage saw it and whatever earlier messages happened to be stored, and a
reply to a thread that began before the watermark, in another folder, or while the app was closed
had no history at all. A conversation newly encountered - or one with gaps - has its missing
history retrieved from the provider: the thread is LISTED first (ids and metadata only), and only
the messages not yet stored have their bodies fetched, once. Fetched history lives on the
conversation as `history` rows (the owner's own sent mail as `context`), never on a task, never in
the feed or Unread, never re-triaged; coverage is recorded per conversation and an incomplete or
failed retrieval is said in the context the model gets, never presented as the whole thread.
