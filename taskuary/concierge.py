"""Taskuary, the assistant you talk to: one item at a time, out of the pipe, in conversation.

This is deliberately the LIGHT brain. It does no work and no routing - the funnel (funnel.py)
decides what comes next, triage already decided what each thing is, the coding agents and the
responder do the doing. What is left for this voice is what a good assistant does at your desk:
"next one - Dana's asking for the corrected file; the reply is drafted, want to read it?" -
two sentences, and then the button under them acts. So it runs on the fast API model the owner
chose for the assistant (general._selected prefers a native connector over launching a CLI),
with a small prompt and a small budget, and when no model is connected at all it still speaks:
the facts on the item are the fallback sentence.

The conversation is the same durable one the floating guide and the WhatsApp doorway use - the
dock task's comments (general.dock_task) - so the chats list is every dock conversation there
has been, and "New chat" archives one and resets the walk. Which card goes under a message is
recorded with the message (a marker the renderer reads and the model never sees), so a reload
draws the same conversation, cards included.

Cards are chosen by CODE from the item's kind, never by the model. The model may only add a
multiple choice at the end of a line (OPTIONS: a | b | c) when a decision has clear choices and
no button covers it; the choice comes back as the owner's next words.
