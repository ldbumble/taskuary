# dispatch() lived here: one open->close HEADLESS run on a task, the CLI working and closing
# where nobody could watch it, interrupt it or answer it. That is precisely the thing this app
# exists to replace, and every road that used it now opens a REAL session instead
# (terminal.start_on_task) or, for a two-sentence reply, asks the main AI directly
# (responder.write_draft). It is deleted rather than left dormant: a headless runner sitting
# in the module is a headless runner somebody wires back up.
#
# run_cli above STAYS, and is not the same thing: it is a one-shot "ask this CLI a question"
# used as a cheap BRAIN (llm.make_cli_llm - triage, drafts, summaries on an agent's light
# model) and by the connector test. No task, no run row, no work performed.
