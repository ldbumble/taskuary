"""Which AI CLIs are actually installed on this machine.

Most people arriving here already pay for one - Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI - and have no
separate API key at all. The setup wizard asked for a key and pointed everyone else at Settings,
which is the wrong way round: the thing they already have should be the first offer.

The flags are not decoration. A headless run with no permission flag waits forever for an
approval nobody can click, so an agent added without them looks installed and then hangs on first
use - the exact failure a wizard exists to prevent.
