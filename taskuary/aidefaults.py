"""The AI defaults in one place: who triages, who codes, who assists - and on which model.

Settings named a BRAIN and stopped there. Which MODEL that brain would actually run was a
different screen every time: the connector's own card for an API key, Connections > AI CLI
agents for a CLI's light gear, and a plain text box for the assistant. Three defaults, three
places, and the Triage & routing page could not tell you what was about to happen next - the
owner asked where the "triage model" was set and the honest answer was "somewhere else, and it
depends" (2026-09-10).

So this module answers one question per slot - WHAT WILL ACTUALLY RUN, AND WHO OWNS IT - and
writes the answer back to whichever screen owns it. It stores nothing of its own: the
connector's `model`, the profile's `model` / `light_model` and the `concierge_model` setting
remain the truth. The older screens keep working and cannot disagree with this one, which is
the whole reason not to introduce a fourth place to set a model.

The split between the two gears is the part worth keeping straight. A CLI agent has a MAIN
model for coding sessions and a LIGHT model for the one-message jobs - triage, drafts,
summaries, the digest (llm.make_cli_llm). Naming the same CLI as both the coder and the triage
brain is normal and cheap; it is the light gear that keeps it cheap.
