"""One worker status model, fed by explicit events, read by every surface (PW-222, PW-226, PW-227, PW-137, PW-139, PW-141).

A session's status was read off its screen: a bare prompt meant "stopped and waiting on you", a quiet
terminal meant a question, and every consumer disagreed with the next. A worker's state is derived
here from explicit, persisted events - Working, Input needed (with the unanswered question), Approval
needed (with the specific pending action), Finished (an explicit result), Failed, Disconnected,
Stopped - keyed by task, run (session id) and request id, deduplicated, with events from a run that is
no longer the task's current one rejected. A response ending (`turn_end`) is not a finish: without an
explicit result or an open request the state is `unknown`, never a guessed hand raise. An answer is
bound to the exact outstanding request and run: delivered once, refused when resolved or when the run
changed, and written into the task's discussion with its delivery outcome.
