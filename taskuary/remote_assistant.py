"""The owner's private doorway into the assistant from a phone chat - WhatsApp or Telegram.

This is deliberately not another bot and not another conversation. A message the owner types in the
one chat they named runs the SAME walk the Assistant tab runs, on the same dock task (general.dock_task),
through the same concierge: the pipe it takes items from, the verbs it decides with and the proposals it
waits on are the desk's. What the desktop draws as a card with action words under it, the phone carries
as words in the message - the choices are appended here, from the item, never invented by the model.

A HANDOFF is the explicit version, and the reason the button exists: the tab hands its walk to the chat
and LOCKS itself, because two screens answering the same item is how the same mail gets replied to twice.
Take it back on the desktop and the chat is told the walk is over.

Only messages the owner themself sent in that named, private chat are accepted. Other people, other
chats and groups continue through the normal funnel.
