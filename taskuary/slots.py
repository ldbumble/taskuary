"""What closes a task: output slots on its checklist (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-task-close-slots-design.md).

A task's ending used to be implied by where it came from - one reply to its sender. An ask whose result is several
messages to several people had nowhere to live, and the first send closed the task and superseded the rest. A slot is
a checklist item that names one output; the task stays open until every slot is sent or dropped (proposals.closed_out).

Its draft is a review of kind `slot`, never `draft_reply`: every "the task's reply" lookup (pending_review, hold_reviews,
agent_reply, the close-out redirect) reads draft kinds, so a slot can never be mistaken for the reply or overwritten by it.
