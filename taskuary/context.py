"""The coder's context file: what the hub knows about a task, written where the agent can read it.

The seed prompt (terminal.seed_text) is one command line. Windows caps it at 32,767 characters
and when it overflows the ASK is what gets cut - so the seed carries the ask, the rules and a two-
line read, and everything else the assistant knows goes HERE: the sender's recent mail and what the
owner last wrote them (counsel.dossier), the same topic elsewhere, open tasks it touches, the
calendar, the learned profile, and PAST WORK - the reports of closed tasks
on this sender, this subject or this repo, which no agent ever saw before (an agent on TQ-0244
knew nothing of what the agent on TQ-0180 found in the same system).

The file lives under Taskuary's own home (~/.taskuary/context/TQ-0244.md), never in a checkout:
a stray file in a shared checkout gets staged by somebody (commit 8abb175 exists because it did),
and a .gitignore in every repo is not ours to write. The seed points at it: "read this first".
