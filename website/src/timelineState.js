// What a Timeline row IS, in one word — and the one place that DECIDES it. The words themselves
// are not here any more: they live in taskuary/lanes.json with the work rail's and the chat's, so
// one situation cannot be "agent waiting on you" on one tab and something else on another (the owner,
// 2026-09-16: "we need this unified and the timeline should have this as well"). This file still
// owns stateOf - which state a row is in - because that is a judgement about a row, not a word.
//
// A Timeline row reads triage's CATEGORY first (roadOf/verdictOf below); the state is what it says
// when the category is not enough.
//
// Colour is named by ROLE, not by hex: theme.jsx stays the only place a colour is chosen.
// `role: null` is a state that takes no colour at all.
// loud: genuinely on you — at most two may ever be loud, or none of them are.
