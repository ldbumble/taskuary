"""Is this someone the owner already deals with?

The one place a stranger's text turns into an agent on the owner's machine with nobody in
between is the coding agent's auto-start. Every comparable tool gates that on the SENDER -
OpenClaw pairs unknown DMs, Copilot ignores users without write access, and this codebase
already does it for GitHub (GH_AUTO) - and email had no such gate. Now it does: a first-time
sender outside the owner's own domains still gets triaged and filed, the task still lands on
the Board; only the automatic session start waits for the owner's click.

"First-time" cannot mean "first time in Taskuary's table": the table starts on the day the
mailbox was connected, and someone the owner has written to weekly for three years would look
like a stranger. So the deep check asks the mailbox itself - has the owner ever SENT this
address anything (Sent Items, one search) - and it runs only for the rare message that reaches
the auto-start decision, once per address: a verified hit is remembered (sender_trust).

The rules are the owner's to see and switch (Settings, PW-079..081): own domains, verified Sent
Items evidence, and chat channels inside a workspace the owner controls. "Has written before" is
NOT one of them - a stranger's own earlier mail, a historical import or a retry never turns them
into someone the owner deals with.
