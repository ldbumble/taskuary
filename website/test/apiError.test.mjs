// The seam, which is where this broke: processingAll's predicates were tested on hand-built error
// objects, api.js's normalizer was never tested at all, and nothing ran the two together. In the
// app the normalizer runs FIRST on every rejection, so a structured refusal reached the deciding
// code as a JSON string that matched no code - the legacy-Timeline fallback, the snapshot reload
// and the Assistant's two pile retries all went unreachable, and a routine "membership is being
// reconciled" surfaced as axios's "Request failed with status code 409" in a red banner.
