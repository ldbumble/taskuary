"""A census reads what it uses - and is invalidated by more than it reads, on purpose.

`SELECT * FROM message` pulled every body into Python on every pass: 8 MB of prose on a real mailbox,
inside BEGIN IMMEDIATE, with wait_settled holding readers behind it. Membership is decided from ids,
kinds and links; a body has never moved an entity between items. That part is pure subtraction.

The other half of this file is a WARNING, written because the obvious next cut is wrong.
PROCESSING_DIRTY_TABLES lists eleven tables and reconcile_membership reads six, so route,
funnel_state, comment, task_artifact and transcript look like free deletions (2026-09-15 - I tried
it). They are not: the display cache is keyed on `self._writes`, a PER-CONNECTION counter, so a
write from another process never moves it, and these triggers are the only thing that turns an
external write into a local generation change. Removing them makes this process serve a stale view
after an agent writes a comment or a peer writes a read receipt - invisible, and hard to trace back.
The thing to attack is the SIZE of the pass, not the length of the list.
