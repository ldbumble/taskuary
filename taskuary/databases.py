"""Named database cards: Postgres, MySQL, ClickHouse, Snowflake, BigQuery.

WHY THESE EXIST WHEN "Any database (connection string)" ALREADY WORKS. That card asks you to know
the SQLAlchemy URL shape and which driver to install, which is fine if you already do and a dead
end if you do not - and "is Postgres supported?" is a question the Connections page should answer
by having a card called Postgres on it. So these are the same executor with the dialect filled in,
the default port known, and the driver named in the error you actually get.

ONE EXECUTOR, FIVE TYPES. Each card either takes the pieces (host, database, user, and the
password from its write-only secret) and this builds the URL, or takes a full `conn_str` and this
gets out of the way. Everything downstream - the query, the row cap, the ODBC fallback - is
db.run_report, unchanged.

THEY ARE ALL READS. scopes puts every one at `read` and none of them ships a write verb: a report
or an agent runs SELECTs. Changing data in a production database is not something this card can
be talked into, whatever the query says, because the engine's own user is the ceiling - so point
these at a read-only account and the ladder holds even if everything above it fails.
