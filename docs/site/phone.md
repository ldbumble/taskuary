The assistant you talk to in the app is reachable from your phone over WhatsApp or Telegram. It is
the same conversation and the same assistant — not a notification feed and not a second, weaker
bot. It can walk you through your work, answer questions about it, and carry out the things the
page can carry out.

## The doorways

A doorway is one chat, on one channel, that the assistant is allowed to speak in. Set it up in
**Settings → Assistant on your phone**, which lists every channel you have connected and lets you
pick the chat and whether it may listen.

1. Connect WhatsApp or Telegram under [Connections](connections#chat).
2. Send a message to the private chat you want to use — on WhatsApp that is the **Message
   yourself** chat.
3. Pick that chat in Settings. Taskuary adds the notification role, names the chat, and switches
   on the assistant for it.

:::rule Only chats you are alone in
The picker offers nothing but chats with one member: you. Groups cannot be selected, because an
answer may name anything in your workspace. The rule is enforced again when a message arrives, so
the picker is a convenience rather than the guard.
:::

Only messages sent by the linked owner account, in that exact chat, are accepted. Taskuary marks
its own bridge output so its notifications can never loop back in as if you had typed them.

## What it can do

Ask it in plain words. These are real examples, not a command list:

- "what needs me?"
- "walk through important email"
- "what is outstanding?"
- "what did the coding agents finish?"
- "reply to Ruth that the numbers are coming tomorrow"

**Walk through** is the one worth knowing. It is the same turn-by-turn walk the Assistant page
runs: one unresolved item at a time, one question, and it waits for your answer before moving on.
The phone is not given a cut-down version of it — the walk carries out the page's job, including
the actions at the end of each item.

Answers you give on the phone land in the desktop conversation too, because it is one
conversation with two doors.

### Choosing

The phone is the desktop Assistant in a chat, word for word. Every button the desktop card draws is a
numbered line here, and on WhatsApp the same choices come again as a **poll** under the message, so one
tap picks - even when the only choice is **Next**. A number or a tap runs exactly what the desktop's button runs,
and no model reads it. Only words you type go to the model.

![A number or a poll tap runs the desktop's action; Not ours asks how far, Send to agent asks which agent, an unclear checkout asks which repository; typed words go to the model](img/phone-choices.svg "A pick is the button; words are words.")

| You send | What happens |
|---|---|
| a number, or a tap in the poll | the desktop button with that name, run at once - and if the model is still answering something you typed, that answer is dropped and the pick goes first |
| **Not ours** | "How far?" — just this once, from now on, or a rule in Settings; the answer you pick runs |
| **Send to agent** | "Which agent?" — triage's pick first, the other one next; the answer you pick runs |
| a coding job with no clear checkout | "Which repository?" — the best guess first; the one you pick starts |
| **Undo** (offered under a receipt that can be undone) | puts the last change back, once |
| **More** | the rest of a long message - or, on a finished agent, its report - then the same choices |
| an old number, after you have already replied | nothing — a list answers one reply, then its numbers are gone |
| anything typed - "next", "undo" and "set up" too | the model reads it, with the same tools as the desktop. No typed word is a shortcut; only a number or a poll tap is a pill |

Typed words are answered by the **Assistant's** brain - the same one, and the same model, as the Assistant tab
(Settings → Triage & agents → Assistant). A Claude Assistant runs at **low effort** unless its model names one
(`claude-sonnet-5@medium`): a turn is a short answer, and Sonnet's own default is high.

### Approving things

A drafted reply comes to the chat with its **Send the reply** choice - the same button as on the desktop, as a
number or a poll tap. Nothing goes out without that pick: approving on your phone is the same deliberate act as
approving on the page. Alerts sent to a notify chat are read-only.

## The morning line

Once a day, the assistant can open with a short line about the day ahead — what slipped, what is
waiting, today's meetings. It is the morning brief's voice, cut to the length of something you
read while walking.

It fires once per day, not once per app start, and it is the same cap the brief itself uses: if
today's line has gone out, reopening the app does not produce another.

## Handing over

When a conversation on the phone reaches something better done at a keyboard — a coding session,
a long document, a report builder — the assistant hands over rather than pretending. The tab it
hands to locks onto that item so you arrive where the conversation left off, and the phone thread
says so plainly instead of going quiet.

The reverse is true too: a walk started on the page can be picked up on the phone, because the
walk's position belongs to the conversation rather than to the surface you started it on.

## What it will not do

- It will not speak in a group chat, or in a chat you did not choose.
- It will not send anything a human has not approved, on any channel.
- It will not change a setting. Settings are changed in the app, deliberately.
- It will not answer someone else in your chat — only the linked owner account is heard.

:::warn WhatsApp is an unofficial bridge
The WhatsApp connector runs a local bridge against an unofficial protocol. It works well, and it
is not a supported WhatsApp product: use a number you can afford to lose. Telegram uses a proper
bot API and has no such caveat.
