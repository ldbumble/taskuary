// The Assistant page IS the Timeline now. The RAIL on the left is the Timeline's own rail (FeedView),
// with the PIPE at its top: what has not been looked at yet, ranked (funnel.py), next-out FIRST -
// triage moves the important things to the top, new things fall in and slide to their slot, and the
// whole day's Timeline runs on below it, dated. The STAGE on the right is one long conversation with
// Taskuary (concierge.py): one item per turn, said in a breath, with the card that acts on it
// underneath; clicking a row pulls it in, a name or a subject typed into it pulls that thing in.
// A meeting in ten minutes or an agent that just asked interrupts as a "by the way" line above the
// composer, whatever the chat is on. Two ways to use the stage, one toggle: CHAT (the default -
// rows go to the conversation) or TASK (rows open on the stage the way the Timeline always did:
// hover previews, click pins). Past chats slide over; New chat starts a fresh conversation.
// Everything durable lives on the server; this file only draws and pushes buttons.
