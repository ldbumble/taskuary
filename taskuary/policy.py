"""Deterministic policy engine: what gets auto-answered, drafted, escalated, or ignored.

Pure - policies and the message come in as dicts, a decision comes out - so every rule is
unit-testable offline and the engine is reusable outside this repo. Fixed precedence
(no confidence score can override it, Basware autonomy-gate pattern):
    skip > ignore > escalate > auto_answer > task_only > default_action
'skip' is for senders that flood you (hundreds of automated notifications): the message
is deduped and stored but never appears on the timeline at all - 'ignore' still shows.
Within one action tier, lowest SortOrder wins. 'draft' policies act like targeted
default overrides and are considered in the task_only tier's place when matched.
