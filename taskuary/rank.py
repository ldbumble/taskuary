"""Bulk processing - rank it, don't clear it.

A worker clears the mailbox: every task is worked in arrival order until the queue is empty.
An executive is cc'd on most of it, and what matters is how much each item deserves attention
RELATIVE to the others. So a connector can be switched from `clear` (today's behaviour) to
`rank`: its coding tasks stop racing for a session and instead enter one value-ordered queue.
The top K (K = auto_sessions, the same "agents at once" the floor shows) are worked; when one
finishes the highest-valued waiting task slides in; new arrivals re-rank the queue rather than
join its tail. Nothing is dropped - a low value waits, it does not vanish - and the owner can
pin a card to the top or push it back.

Value is two layers, and the split is the point:
  floor()  - deterministic, from what the funnel already knows (addressed to you or cc'd, how
             many people, whether a colleague has replied, urgency, who the author is on a code
             host). Runs on everything, costs nothing, and is never shown as a number: the card
             shows the WORDS it came from.
  rank()   - one small listwise call, and its order IS the rank. Ranking is cheap where
             classifying is not: forty subjects in one call, not forty calls. Debounced, and
             the floor is what answers when no brain is configured.

Two queues are ranked, by the same rule and by two functions:
  rank_pending() - the arrivals waiting to be TRIAGED. Only the head of it is judged, and a
                   slot opens as the owner settles one, so 300 pull requests cost a handful
                   of calls instead of 300. It reads the raw arrival: there is no task yet.
  rerank()       - the tasks waiting for an AGENT, ordered by the same rule.
