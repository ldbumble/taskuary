<!-- Written by `python -m taskuary.toolcatalog` from taskuary/toolcatalog.py - edit the catalogue, not this page. -->

What the Assistant is told about its tools. It gets the **summary** on every turn: the buckets, and
each tool's name and what it needs. It asks for the **detail** of a bucket (`tools.list`) or a tool
(`tools.describe`) only when a turn needs it. Everything it can change becomes a card you confirm,
except the few that can be undone, which run at once with an undo on the receipt.

## The summary, sent every turn

| Bucket | What it is for | Tools, and what each needs |
|---|---|---|
| **table** | decide about the item on the table | reply(text), approve, redraft(text), mine, regular_agent(text, as?), coder(text, as?), not_ours, not_ours_sender, block_sender, close, done, next, answer_agent(text), stop_agent, rerun, remember(text), setup(text), clear(text), confirm, cancel |
| **task** | change any task - the one on the table or one named with ref | task.update(priority/title/assignee), task.set_kind(kind), task.set_repo(repo), task.check(item, done?), task.comment(text), task.split(text), task.merge(into), task.reopen, task.not_a_task, task.complete, task.defer(until), task.handoff(who, note?), task.clarify(text), review.approve, review.reject |
| **agents** | start, continue, answer or stop the agent on a task, and teach where work belongs | dispatch.prepare(kind, instructions?), agent.continue, agent.answer(text), agent.stop, routing.remember(field, value) |
| **new** | new work with no task yet | task.create_from_text(kind, text), task.create_from_message(kind), task.setup(text) |
| **pipe** | the walk and sets of items, and filing mail | pipe.clear, item.settle(verb), message.file, message.archive, preference.exclude_sender(scope), preference.sender_rule |
| **reports** | reports and workflows | report.create(config), report.run, report.rerun, report.pause, report.resume, report.reach(reach), report.edit(config), report.delete |
| **app** | settings, connections, scripts and kept facts | setting.set(setting, value), connection.create(type, name), connection.test, connection.pause, connection.resume, script.start(name), memory.remember(note), hub.publish(title, body, topic?, kind?, why_earned?) |
| **look** | look-ups - they run at once and change nothing | task.read, timeline.search, tasks.list, message.read, sender.read, docs.search, agents.now, approvals.list, pipe.list, calendar.read, activity.list, errors.list, memory.list, rules.list, report.read, reports.list, settings.list, setting.read, connections.list, connection.read, agents.list, repos.list, tools.list, tools.describe, knowledge.search |

A task you name goes in `ref` ("TQ-0123"); otherwise the tool acts on what is on the table.

<p class="runs">Waits for your yes on a card.</p>

### `message.archive`

Archive it: off the pipe and closed, nothing deleted.

<p class="runs">Waits for your yes on a card.</p>
