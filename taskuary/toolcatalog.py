"""Every road the assistant can take, written from the code that runs them.

The chat used to answer with a VERB from a list in prose, and code then guessed the target: which
items a sweep meant, which task a phrase named. That seam is where promises broke - "dismiss all the
tasks that are the category report" became the WORD "report" matched against subject lines, so 13 of
72 were cleared and the answer still said done (the owner, 2026-09-07).

So the model is given the operations themselves - generated from operations.KINDS, which is the same
registry server._run_operation dispatches on, so this catalogue cannot drift from what actually runs -
and it answers with a CALL naming the kind and its parameters, including a SELECTOR when the target is
a description rather than one row.

Nothing here executes. A CALL becomes a proposal exactly as a verb does; the owner's confirmation is
still what runs it (PW-123/124), and the AUTO verbs are still the only things that go straight through.
